# Project Plan: Intelligent Browser-based Code Editing Platform

This document outlines a detailed, four-phase plan to develop the Intelligent Browser-based Code Editing Platform. The plan is structured to tackle foundational elements first and progressively build towards more complex, AI-driven features.

---

### Phase 1: Building the MVP - The Core Editor and File System Bridge

**Objective:** To create a functional, browser-based editor that can successfully open a local project directory, display its file tree, and allow for the reading and writing of individual files. This phase focuses on establishing the foundational architecture.

*   **Backend (Node.js/Express):**
    1.  **Initialize Server:** Set up a basic Express.js server.
    2.  **File System API:** Create a set of RESTful API endpoints to act as a bridge to the local file system.
        *   `GET /api/files/tree?path=<directory>`: Recursively scans a given directory path and returns a JSON structure representing the file tree.
        *   `GET /api/file/content?path=<file>`: Reads the content of a specified file and returns it as a string.
        *   `POST /api/file/content?path=<file>`: Receives a request body with new content and overwrites the specified file.
    3.  **CORS and Security:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend.

*   **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**
    1.  **Project Setup:** Create a standard frontend project structure.
    2.  **Integrate Monaco Editor:** Embed the Monaco Editor into the main view.
    3.  **File Tree UI:** Develop a collapsible file tree component that fetches data from the backend's `/api/files/tree` endpoint.
    4.  **State Management:** Clicking a file in the tree loads its content into the Monaco Editor via `/api/file/content`.
    5.  **Saving Changes:** Implement a save mechanism that sends the editor's content to the `POST /api/file/content` endpoint.

*   **Outcome of Phase 1:** A working prototype where a user can open a local project folder and perform basic file editing operations entirely within the browser.

### Phase 2: Introducing Intelligence - Core AI Integration

**Objective:** To integrate the Google Gemini API and provide users with basic, on-demand AI assistance for single-file operations.

*   **Backend:**
    1.  **Gemini API Setup:** Integrate the Google Gemini SDK and manage API keys securely.
    2.  **AI Service Module:** Create a dedicated module (`ai.service.js`) to handle all interactions with the Gemini API.
    3.  **New AI Endpoint:** Develop `POST /api/ai/request` to accept code and a prompt, pass it to the Gemini API, and stream the response.

*   **Frontend:**
    1.  **AI Interaction UI:** Add UI elements for AI interaction (e.g., a context menu option or a chat panel).
    2.  **Displaying AI Suggestions:** Implement a "diff view" component to clearly show the AI's proposed changes before application.
    3.  **Applying Changes:** Add an "Accept" button to apply the AI's suggestion to the code in the editor.

*   **Outcome of Phase 2:** The editor becomes "intelligent." A user can select code, ask the AI to perform a task (explain, refactor), and apply the suggested changes.

### Phase 3: Scaling Up - Performance, Context, and Quality Assurance

**Objective:** To evolve the prototype into a tool that can handle large, real-world projects and to ensure the AI's suggestions are high-quality and context-aware.

*   **Performance Enhancements (Backend):**
    1.  **Asynchronous File Watching:** Use `chokidar` for efficient, event-driven file system monitoring to keep the UI in sync.
    2.  **Worker Threads:** Offload intensive initial project indexing to a Worker Thread to keep the UI responsive.
    3.  **Search Implementation:** Integrate Fuse.js for fast full-text search.

*   **Advanced AI Context Management (Backend):**
    1.  **AST-Based Chunking:** Use an Abstract Syntax Tree parser (e.g., `acorn`) to break code into semantic chunks for more structured AI context.
    2.  **Dependency Graph v1:** Implement basic dependency analysis to include imported files in the context sent to the AI.

*   **Quality Assurance:**
    1.  **Linter/Formatter Integration:** Integrate ESLint and Prettier on the backend.
    2.  **Automated Quality Gates:** Automatically run AI suggestions through the formatter and linter before showing them to the user.

*   **Outcome of Phase 3:** The platform is performant and robust, capable of handling large codebases. The AI's suggestions are more intelligent and reliable due to improved context and automated quality checks.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem - Collaboration, Desktop, and Extensibility

**Objective:** To transform the tool into a professional-grade, extensible platform that supports collaboration and is not limited by browser constraints.

*   **Version Control (Git Integration):**
    1.  **Git Backend:** Use a library like `isomorphic-git` to perform Git operations.
    2.  **Automated Commits:** Automatically commit every accepted AI change to a new branch for a clear audit trail and easy rollbacks.
    3.  **UI for Git:** Build frontend components to visualize commit history.

*   **Desktop Application (Electron/Tauri):**
    1.  **Wrap the Application:** Package the web application into an Electron or Tauri shell.
    2.  **Native File System Access:** Leverage native file system access to bypass browser sandbox limitations and improve performance.

*   **Plugin Architecture:**
    1.  **Refactor Core Logic:** Abstract all language-specific logic into a pluggable system.
    2.  **Define Plugin API:** Create a clear API for third-party plugins to add language support, new commands, or custom UI.

*   **Multi-User Collaboration (Stretch Goal):**
    1.  **Real-time Backend:** Integrate WebSockets for persistent, low-latency communication.
    2.  **CRDTs/OT:** Implement a synchronization algorithm (like CRDTs) to enable real-time collaborative editing.

*   **Outcome of Phase 4:** The project evolves into a full-fledged platform with deep Git integration, a stable desktop app, community extensibility, and real-time collaboration capabilities.
